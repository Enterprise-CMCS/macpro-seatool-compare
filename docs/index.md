## Welcome!

The {{ site.repo.name }} project is a microservice compares legacy data and seatool data and sends notifications when certain conditions are met.

This project is under active development by the MACPRO Platform team.  Read on for more details, and feel free to join us on [Slack](https://cmsgov.slack.com/archives/C045M44HA0Y).

The purpose of this project is to compare each customer submitted record in MMDL against its government entered counterpart record in SEATOOL. This should perform similar comparisons logic n number of after the MMDL submission, and then again until needed. If comparisons come back with a negative result we send an email to interested parties. 

Thanks, and we're glad you're here!
